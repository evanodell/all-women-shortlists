\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

Previous research on gender differences in political speech patterns has
focused on differences between male and female politicians (Yu,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-yu2014}{2014}) or on variations in Hilary
Clinton's speech patterns (Bligh, Merolla, Schroedel, \& Gonzalez,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bligh2010}{2010}; Jones,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-jones2016}{2016}). This paper focuses on
differences in speech patterns between female Labour MPs nominated
through All Women Shortlists (AWS) and female Labour MPs nominated
through open shortlists. We examined differences in speaking styles
using the \texttt{Linguistic\ Inquiry\ and\ Word\ Count\ 2015} (LIWC)
dictionary (Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, \& Blackburn,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pennebaker2015}{2015}) and the \texttt{spaCy}
(Honnibal \& Montani, \protect\hyperlink{ref-honnibal2017}{2017})
Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagger. We examined differences in the topics
discussed by AWS and non-AWS MPs, using \({\chi}^2\) tests for
individual words and for bigrams. We trained a Naive Bayes classifier to
distinguish AWS and non-AWS speeches. We used structured topic models
(STM) to identify the topics discussed by AWS and non-AWS MPs.

To account for the possible effects of age, parliamentary experience and
cohort, and in order to compare women selected through all women
shortlists to women who were not (but who theoretically had the
opportunity to contest all-women shortlists), our analysis is been
restricted only to Labour MPs first elected to the House of Commons in
the 1997 General Election, up to but excluding the 2017 General
Election. Comparisons between MPs of different parties are also
restricted to MPs first elected in the 1997 General Election, and before
the 2017 General Election. Speeches made by the Speaker, including
Deputy Speakers, were also excluded. Words contained in parentheses were
removed, as they are added by Hansard to provide additional information
not actually spoken by the MP.\footnote{e.g.~a reference to ``the member
  for Bethnal Green and Bow'' in keeping with Parliamentary convention
  of identifying MPs by their seat rather than their name would be
  followed by ``(Rushnara Ali)''.} Speeches and data on MPs' gender and
party affiliation are from a previously assembled dataset (Odell,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-odell2018}{2018}). Information on candidates
selected through all women shortlists is from the House of Commons
Library (Kelly \& White, \protect\hyperlink{ref-kelly2016}{2016}).
Unsuccessful General Election candidates selected through all women
shortlists who were subsequently elected in a byelection are classified
as having been selected on an all women shortlist, regardless of the
selection process for that byelection. Speeches made by MPs while
suspended from the Labour party where classified the same as if they had
not been suspended. The dataset includes 408 different Labour MPs, 167
female MPs, 119 elected from All Women Shortlists and 48 elected from
open shortlists, along with 241 male MPs.

\hypertarget{linguistic-inquiry-and-word-count}{%
\subsection{Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count}\label{linguistic-inquiry-and-word-count}}

Word classification used the
\texttt{Linguistic\ Inquiry\ and\ Word\ Count\ 2015} (LIWC) dictionary
(Pennebaker et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-pennebaker2015}{2015}) and
tokenising tools from the \texttt{Quanteda} \texttt{R} package (Benoit,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-benoit2018}{2018}). Word counts and
words-per-sentence, and calculations for determining grade level
(Kincaid, Fishburne, Rogers, \& Chissom,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kincaid1975}{1975}) were produced using
\texttt{stringi} (Gagolewski,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gagolewski2018}{2018}), an \texttt{R} wrapper to
the ICU regex library.

Following research by Yu (\protect\hyperlink{ref-yu2014}{2014}) and
Newman, Groom, Handelman, \& Pennebaker
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-newman2008}{2008}) on gender differences in
language, we focused on the following LIWC categories to compare MPs'
speeches:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All Pronouns (pronoun)
\item
  First person singular pronouns (i) 
\item
  First person plural pronouns (we)
\item
  Verbs (verb)
\item
  Auxiliary verbs (auxverb) 
\item
  Social processes (social) 
\item
  Positive emotions (posemo) 
\item
  Negative emotions (negemo) 
\item
  Tentative words (tentat)
\item
  Articles (article) 
\item
  Prepositions (preps) 
\item
  Anger words (anger)
\item
  Swear words (swear)
\item
  Cognitive processes (cogproc)
\item
  Words longer than six letters (Sixltr)
\end{itemize}

We also included mean words-per-sentence (WPS), total speach word count
(WC) and Flesch--Kincaid grade level (FK) (Kincaid et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kincaid1975}{1975}), calculated using the
\texttt{Quanteda} (Benoit, \protect\hyperlink{ref-benoit2018}{2018}) and
\texttt{stringi} (Gagolewski,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gagolewski2018}{2018}) \texttt{R} packages.

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging was done using the \texttt{spaCy} library

the \texttt{spacyr} package (Benoit \& Matsuo,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-benoit2018a}{2018}). There is one small gender
difference (\emph{d} = -0.22) in the use of plural nouns, which make up
5.86\% of the words used by female Labour MPs, compared to 5.04\% of
words spoken by male Labour MPs. As with LIWC, there are no categories
where \emph{d} \textgreater{}= \(|0.2|\) when comparing female Labour
MPs by selection process, and only one category -- plural nouns -- with
an effect size of \emph{d} \textgreater{}= \(|0.1|\).

\subsection{Keyness}\label{keyness}}

We calculated the keyness of words to identify gender differences in the
choices of topics raised and terminology used by both male and female
Labour MPs, and by short-list and non-shortlist female Labour MPs. We
have also calculated keyness between Labour and Conservative MPs for the
purposes of illustration. All keyness figures include the 25 most
disproportionately common words among each group, as determined by
\({\chi}^2\) tests using \texttt{quanteda} (Benoit,

Unsurprisingly, despite male MPs saying almost twice as many words
(65,827,133 vs 34,159,304) as their female colleagues, female Labour MPs
were more than two-and-a-half (2.61) times as likely to say ``women''.
They were also much more likely to use ``women's'' and ``woman'' in
parliamentary debate. Female Labour MPs also appear much more likely to
discuss ``children'', ``people'', ``care'', ``families'', ``home'',
``parents'', ``work'' and social policy areas such as ``services'',
``disabled {[}people{]}'' and ``housing'' than their male colleagues.
Male MPs were more likely to refer to military topics (``Iraq'',
``nuclear''), and to parliamentary process and protocol -- ``question'',
``political'', ``conservative'', ``electoral'', ``house'', ``party'',
``argument'' ``liberal'' and ``point'' are far more common in speeches
by male Labour MPs than by female ones. This could suggest that male
Labour MPs are more comfortable using the traditional language of House
of Commons debate, and are more concerned with the rules, procedures and
processes of the parliamentary system than their female colleagues.

amongst AWS MPs included ``carers'', ``disabled'', ``bedroom'' and
``sen'' (Special Educational Needs). Also of note is AWS MPs making more
references to their ``constituency'' and its ``constituents'',
suggesting that AWS MPs may draw more heavily on the fact they were
elected by their constituents as a source political legitimacy, or are
more likely to illustrate a point with an example from their
constitutency, compared to non-AWS MPs.

The keyness differences (Figure \ref{fig:lab-con-keyness}) between
Labour and Conservative MPs are much greater than gender or AWS
differences within Labour. The very high use of ``Lady'' by Conservative
MPs is reflective of the greater proportion of female MPs in other
parties, as it is often used to refer to comments by other members of
the house. It may also represent a greater use of traditional house
decorum by Conservative MPs.

\subsection{Naive Bayes

We trained a Naive Bayes classifier with document-frequency priors and a
multinomial distribution to predict the gender of speakers when given
speeches by all Labour MPs in our dataset, and the selection process
when only given female Labour MPs. The accuracy of both models were
roughly equivalent, 70.67\% accuracy when predicting gender and 71.22\%
when predicting shortlists. By contrast, the classifier could
distinguish between Labour and Conservative speeches with 74.23\%
accuracy.

\hypertarget{topic-models}{%
\subsection{Topic Models}\label{topic-models}}

Using topic models to classify text is widely used in social sciences
(Grimmer \& Stewart, \protect\hyperlink{ref-grimmer2013}{2013}), as,
when combined with the large volume of plain text data available, it
allows for a rapid and consistent method of analysis . Topic modelling
and other statistic methods of textual analysis are not a substitute for
reading the texts themselves, but can augment other analysis or -- as in
this case -- analyse and classify larger amounts of text than would be
feasible using human coders (Grimmer \& Stewart,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-grimmer2013}{2013}). Topic models classify a
series of documents (in this case individual speeches) into one of a
given number of topics, identifying terms that are common in some
documents but rare in others. When developing topic models, there is a
trade-off between high precision in the classification of each document
with broader topics when using smaller numbers of topics, or lower
precision in individual speech classification with more finely-grained
topics when using larger numbers of topics. Grimmer \& Stewart
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-grimmer2013}{2013}) also highlight the
importance of validating unsurpervised topic models when applied to new
sets of texts, which we have done
\protect\hyperlink{Manualux5cux2520Validation}{below}.

The R package \texttt{stm} (Roberts, Stewart, \& Tingley,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}) implements a structured topic
model (STM) (Arora et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-arora2013}{2013};
Roberts, Stewart, \& Airoldi,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2016}{2016}). An STM incorporates
covariates into the topic classification algorithm, creating
possibilities for hypothesis testing. This differs from traditional
topic modelling methods using latent variables to identify topics
(e.g.~with latent Dirichlet allocation Blei, Ng, \& Jordan,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-blei2003}{2003}), and then comparing proportions
of each topic to one or more external variables. STM allows us to
incorporate the variables we are interested in to the topic model itself
using a generalised linear model; i.e.~the proportion of speechs
classified as belonging to each topic can vary as a function of the AWS
and gender variables.

We incorporated the AWS status of speakers and their gender as
prevalence covariates into our topic model.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We created six topic models with different numbers of topics (\emph{K}).
We created models with 30, 45, 60, 80 and 100 topics, and used a topic
selection algorithm developed by Lee \& Mimno
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee2014c}{2014}), implemented in the
\texttt{stm} package (Roberts et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}), which resulted in \emph{K} =
66. Figure \ref{fig:topic-model-selection-plot} shows, clockwise from
the top-left, the exclusivity score, held out likelihood with 50\% of
documents held out, the multinomial dispersion of the STM residuals
(Taddy, \protect\hyperlink{ref-taddy2012}{2012}), semantic coherence
(Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders, \& McCallum,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mimno2011}{2011}), and the lower bound of each
topic model.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{methodology_files/figure-latex/topic-model-selection-plot-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:topic-model-selection-plot}Topic Model Selection}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:topic-model-selection-plot}, the \emph{K} =
66 result appears to produce the best result, a topic model with 66
topics, across 251,072 speeches with a dictionary of 241,625 words. All
models were created using the ``spectral'' method developed by Arora et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-arora2013}{2013}), implemented in the
\texttt{stm} package by Roberts et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}).

Figure \ref{fig:stm-network-graph} is a Fruchterman-Reingold
force-directed diagram (Fruchterman \& Reingold,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-fruchterman1991}{1991}) of correlations between
different topics. Larger vertices indicate more common topics (amongst
both male and female Labour MPs), and the colour scale indicates the
proportion of speeches classed in that topic made by AWS and non-AWS
female Labour MPs, respectively. Edges indicate positive correlations
between the two linked topics.

The \texttt{stm} package includes the \texttt{estimateEffect} function,
which creates a regression model (Table \ref{tab:estimate-table-k0})
using individual documents (speeches) as observations, with the
proportion of a each document fitting each topic as the dependent
variable and model covariates (AWS status and gender) as independent
variables. The intercept in this model is all speeches by male Labour
MPs.

Table \ref{tab:topic-summary-table} shows the number and percentage of
speeches assigned to each topic, based on its \(\theta\) value. The
results in this table differ slightly from those in Table
\ref{tab:estimate-table-k0}, as it uses a ``winner-take-all'' method to
assign an overall topic to each speech, rather than a prevalence of a
given topic across all speeches. One of the topics -- Topic 66 -- is
never the most likely topic in the matrix of number of documents by
number of topics -- labelled \(\theta\) by Roberts et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}) -- and so while it is
included in the model, assignment of single topics to speeches uses the
highest \(\theta\) for each speech. Other topics are rarely used --
Topic 53, which we labelled ``Dispatch Box'', only has five topics
assigned to it, four from Male MPs and one from an AWS MP.

\end{figure}

We created six topic models with different numbers of topics (\emph{K}).
We created models with 30, 45, 60, 80 and 100 topics, and used an
algorithm developed by Lee \& Mimno
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lee2014c}{2014}), implemented in the
\texttt{stm} package (Roberts et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}), which resulted in \emph{K} =
66. Figure \ref{topic-model-selection} shows, clockwise from the
top-left, heldout likelihood {[}explain{]}, lower bound {[}explain{]},
semantic coherence (Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders, \& McCallum,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mimno2011}{2011}), and the multinomial dispersion
of the STM residuals (Taddy, \protect\hyperlink{ref-taddy2012}{2012}),

As seen in Figure \ref{topic-model-selection}, the \emph{K} = 66 result
appears to produce the best result, a topic model with 66 topics, across
251,072 speeches with a dictionary of 241,625 words. All models were
created using the ``spectral'' method developed by Arora et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-arora2013}{2013}), implemented in the
\texttt{stm} package by Roberts et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}).

One of the topics -- Topic 66 -- is never the most likely topic in the
matrix of number of documents by number of topics -- labelled \(\theta\)
by Roberts et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-roberts2018}{2018}) -- and so
while it is included in the model, assignment of single topics to
speeches uses the highest \(\theta\) for each speech. Other topics are
rarely used -- Topic 53, which we labelled ``Dispatch Box'', only has
five topics assigned to it, four from Male MPs and one from an AWS MP.

Figure \ref{k0-network} is a Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed diagram
(Fruchterman \& Reingold, \protect\hyperlink{ref-fruchterman1991}{1991})
of correlations between different topics. Larger vertices indicate more
common topics, and the colour scale indicates the proportion of speeches
classed in that topic made by AWS and non-AWS female Labour MPs,
respectively. Edges indicate positive correlations between the two
linked topics.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{methodology_files/figure-latex/stm-analysis-k0-network-graph-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{k0-network}Fruchterman-Reingold plot of Topic Network}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{stm} package includes the \texttt{estimateEffect} function,
which creates a regression model (Table 9) using individual documents
(speeches) as observations, with the proportion of a each document
fitting each topic as the dependent variable and model covariates (AWS
status and gender) as independent variables. The intercept in this model
is all speeches by male Labour MPs.

Table 10 shows the number and percentage of speeches assigned to each
topic, based on its \(\theta\) value. The results in this table differ
slightly from those in Table 9, as it uses a ``winner-take-all'' method
to assign an overall topic to each speech, rather than a prevalence of a
given topic across all speeches.

The table below shows the twenty most common words in each topic, and
the twenty words with the highest FREX score, a measure that uses a
harmonic mean of word exclusivity and topic coherence (Airoldi \&
Bischof, \protect\hyperlink{ref-airoldi2016}{2016}). We have named each
topic based on the most common words and highest FREX score words in

We have validated both the topics produced by the model and our labels
of those topics to ensure the topics themselves are both interesting and
relevant. Validation is particularly important in unsupervised models
including STM (Grimmer \& Stewart,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-grimmer2013}{2013}). Quinn, Monroe, Colaresi,
Crespin, \& Radev (\protect\hyperlink{ref-quinn2010}{2010}) suggest that
topics are valid if they correspond to external events. Figure

\subsection{Differences between Male, AWS and non-AWS Labour
MPs}\label{differences-between-male-aws-and-non-aws-labour-mps}}

From Table \ref{tab:estimate-table-k0} we can see the relationship
between the frequency of topics among AWS, non-AWS and male Labour MPs.

There are 11 topics where the frequency AWS MPs is significantly
different from male MPs, but where its frequency amongst non-AWS MPs is
not significantly different. They are topics 1, 6, 7, 8, 14, 17, 20, 26,
35, 36, 39. 5 topics are proportionally greater among AWS MPs (Topic 8,
Schools, Topic 14, Policy impact, Topic 26, Pensions, Topic 35, Alcohol
\& tobacco, Topic 36, Place names) and 6 topics are less common (Topic
1, Employment \& unions, Topic 6, Northern Ireland, Topic 7, Committee,
Topic 17, Communications, Topic 20, International development, Topic 39,
Private companies).

There are 7 topics where its proportion amongst non-AWS MPs is
significantly different from male MPs, but where its proportion amongst
AWS MPs is not significantly different. They are topics 5, 16, 24, 37,
44, 46, 57. 5 topics are proportionally greater among AWS MPs (Topic 16,
Regional development, Topic 37, Budget, Topic 44, Utilities \& PFI,
Topic 46, Local authorities, Topic 57, Locations) and 2 topics are less
common (Topic 5, Police, firefighters \& prison, Topic 24, Higher
education \& skills).

There is 1 topic (Topic 50, Questions) where there is no significant
difference in frequency among both AWS and non-AWS MPS, relative to male
Labour MPs.

There are 10 topics where AWS and non-AWS MPs differ significantly in
proportion from male Labour MPs, but are not both higher/lower than male
MPs. AWS MPs are significantly more likely to mention 5 topics (Topic
13, Ministers, Topic 22, Sport \& culture, Topic 38, Tax, Topic 49,
Transport, Topic 58, Jobs \& manufacturing) than male MPs, while non-AWS
mps are significantly less likely to mention those topics. The opposite
is true for the other 5 topics (Topic 2, Legal system, Topic 18,
Immigration, Topic 28, Issues, Topic 42, Bills, Topic 59, Small
business), which AWS MPs are significantly less likely and non-AWS MPs
are significantly more likely to mention than male Labour MPs.

Using the frequency of a topic among male MPs as a baseline, there are
35 topics where the frequency among AWS MPs is proportionally closer, in
absolute terms, than the frequency of the topic among female MPs. The
inverse is true for the remaining 31 topics.

Relative to each other, there are 34 topics where the frequency between
AWS and non-AWS MPs are closer to each other than either is to the topic
frequency in male MPs. In 18 topics, the frequency between AWS and male
MPs are the most similar, and in the remaining 14 topics the difference
in frequency are smallest between non-AWS and male MPs. See
\ref{tab:absolute-differences} for details.

On the hypothesis that non-AWS MPs are more similar to male MPs in their
topic selection, the following are topics with the largest absolute
differences between AWS and other MPs.

Figure \ref{fig:p-effect1} shows the frequency for the topics where AWS
and non-AWS MPs differ the most. Figure \ref{fig:p-effect2} shows the
frequency for the topics where AWS and non-AWS MPs are most similar to
each other, regardless of their similarity to male Labour MPs. Figure
\ref{fig:p-effect-cv} is the topics with the most variation, between
AWS, non-AWS and male Labour MPs. Figures \ref{fig:p-effect1},
\ref{fig:p-effect2} and \ref{fig:p-effect-cv} all use the coefficient of
variation to measure variance between each group of MPs. Figures
\ref{fig:p-effect1} and \ref{fig:p-effect2} only use female Labour MPS,
Figure \ref{fig:p-effect-cv} uses all three groups.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

There do not appear to be substantial or meaningful differences in the
speaking styles of female Labour MPs selected through all women
shortlists when compared to their female colleagues selected through
open shortlists using LIWC. This is possibly due to the speaking style
dominant in British parliamentary debate, which is more formal than the
speech used in most day-to-day conversation. LIWC was developed by
American researchers, and the LIWC dictionary may not be able to capture
stylistic differences between American and British English, and may not
include words commonly used in formal British English speech, limiting
its usefulness in the context of British political debate.

There is more distinction between AWS and non-AWS MPs in terms and
topics.
\protect\hyperlink{ux5cux2520Naiveux5cux2520Bayesux5cux2520classification}{Naive
Bayes classification} was able to accurately determine the AWS status of
female Labour MPs with slightly greater accuracy than it could
distinguish between male and female Labour MPs (71.22\% and 70.67\%,
respectively).

AWS MPs are far more likely to make reference to their constituency and
constituents. In the debate between whether MPs should be ``delegates''
or ``trustees'' -- the ``mandate-independence controversy'' outlined by
Pitkin (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pitkin1967}{1967}) -- the references to
their constituents and constituencies suggests AWS MPs shy away from the
Burkean concept of trusteeship and see themselves more as strict
representatives of their constituents. In Andeweg \& Thomassen's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-andeweg2005}{2005}) typology of \emph{ex
ante}/\emph{ex post} and above/below political representation, AWS MPs
lean towards representation ``from below'', although their selection
process is \emph{ex ante}/\emph{ex post}. AWS MPs also use events and
individuals in their constituency as examples when speaking on a given
topic (see the
\protect\hyperlink{ux5cux2520AWSux5cux2520Referencesux5cux2520toux5cux2520Constituentsux5cux2520inux5cux2520Context}{Appendix}
for more examples).

AWS MPs refer to their constituents both specifically and in the
abstract, particularly when criticising government policy. For example,
in debate on 4th March 2015, Gemma Doyle, than the Labour MP for West
Dunbartonshire (elected on an AWS in 2010), when asked if she would give
way to Conservative MP Stephen Mosley, responded:

\begin{quote}
No, I will not {[}give way{]}, because my constituents want me to make
these points, not to give more time to Conservative Members.
\end{quote}

On 2nd June 2010, during debate on Israel-Palestine, Valerie Vaz, MP for
Walsall South, also used the views of her constituents to support her
position:

\begin{quote}
My constituents want more than pressure. Will the Foreign Secretary come
back to the House and report on a timetable for the discussions on a
diplomatic solution, just as we did on Ireland?
\end{quote}

On 4th April 2001, Betty Williams, member for Conwy from 1997--2010,
raised the case of a wilderness guide in her constituency unable to
access parts of the countryside due to foot and mouth disease:

\begin{quote}
Is my right hon. Friend aware that there is continuing concern about the
limited access to the countryside and crags of north Wales? May I draw
his attention to the circumstances of my constituent, Ric Potter? Like
many others, he has had to travel to Scotland, where there is greater
access. Will my right hon. Friend help us to enable people such as Ric
Potter to find work in outdoor pursuits?
\end{quote}
